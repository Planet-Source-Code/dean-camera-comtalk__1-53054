Extra ComTalk Information:
--------------------------

ComTalk is packed as an .exe by a program called UPX, a freeware program avaliable off the
Internet. This program can compress any .exe or .dll file to a fraction of it's original
size, while still retaining it's .exe and .dll extention - the file still works normally in
its compressed state. UPX is used to compress the ComTalk.exe file from hundreds of kb to
under 300kb.

ComTalk MUST be run outside of VB as an ActiveX EXE for plugins to work correctly. If you
have change ComTalk to a Standard EXE, the "CTLink" class module's instancing property must
be set as "6 - GlobalMultiUse".

Although ComTalk is not reccomended to be run inside VB, it can be done so long as all
are disabled (open all plugin .exe files and select "Don't use in ComTalk". When run in VB,
ComTalk will output Debug information into the Immediate window.

WARNING: ComTalk uses subclassing (hooks to system functions.) Using the "stop" button while
	 ComTalk is running inside VB can case VB to crash. Use the "Exit" command ONLY.
